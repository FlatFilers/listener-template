# Plugins

Flatfile provides a set of plugins that can be used to extend the functionality of your agent. These plugins can be 
found in the [Flatfile Plugins repository](https://github.com/flatfile/flatfile-plugins) and are available for installation
on NPM.

## Writing Plugins

The plugins Flatfile has published may not be exactly what you need. In this case, you can write your own plugin to 
extend the functionality of your agent.

### Extractors

Extractors are used to extract data from a source file and convert it into Flatfile Workbooks and Sheets. To build an 
extractor, follow the guide [here](../building-extractors/AGENT.md).
