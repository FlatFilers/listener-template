# Blueprint Overview


Blueprint is your guide to structuring data in Flatfile. It defines how your data should look, behave, and connectâ€”from simple field validations to complex relationships between datasets. Think of it as a smart schema that helps you collect exactly the data you need, in exactly the format you want it.

### Basic Structure

    /**
     * @FlatfileConstraints
     */
    export const sheetName: Flatfile.SheetConfig = {
      name: "Sheet Name",
      slug: "sheet-slug",
      readonly: false,
      allowAdditionalFields: false,
      fields: [
        // Field definitions go here
      ]
    };
